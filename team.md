## Consortium partners

The consortium is built upon renowned scientific organizations in the field of water resource management and leading EO industrial partner: University of Leicester – UK (prime contractor, scientific and project lead), The Spanish State Agency of the Higher Council for Scientific Research (AECSIC) – ES (sub-contractor, scientific & methods lead), DHI – DK (sub-contractor, product generation, system implementation, promotion and outreach).

The consortium partners blend a proven track record on Earth Observation and expertise within a number of high priority applications, with the technical competences for large-scale EO-processing required to push state-of-the-art within EO based information product development, while at the same time demonstrate utility through co-development with Champion Users and ensure user uptake beyond the project span.

![University of Leicester](images/UoL.png "University of Leicester") **The University of Leicester (UoL)**  is one of the UK's leading research and teaching universities. The University of Leicester is, according to the Times newspaper, "An award winning institution attracting top academics". The University has 19,000 students, including 8,000 at postgraduate level. There are 34 academic departments located in five faculties: Arts, Law, Medicine and Biological Sciences, Science and Social Sciences. There is a University-wide Graduate School and an Institute of Lifelong Learning. The University employs approximately 3,500 staff.

The Earth Observation Science group is an interdisciplinary team working across the Departments of Physics/Astronomy, Chemistry and Geography. A strong component of the team, led by Prof. Hartmut Boesch, is based in the Space Research Centre of the Department of Physics and Astronomy, which houses one of the largest space research groups in Europe. The group particularly focuses on the use of Earth Observation (EO) space systems to understand regional and global causes of variability of climate, particularly in the land/ocean surface and the atmosphere; other remote sensing systems are also extensively used such as aircraft, ground-based, and ship-borne sensors. The group also hosts the Directorate and Leicester science unit of the National Centre for Earth Observation led by Prof. John Remedios. The surface temperature activities of EOS at Leicester are integrated into the NCEO Leicester science unit, benefitting from strategic support at national level. Studies of the ATSR and Sentinel-3 missions are key projects in the Leicester surface temperature team. The Leicester PI team (PI, Prof. Remedios) for ATSR has been leading the ATSR programme since 1993. The PI team has been particularly concerned to support algorithm developments, assess data quality and analyze long-term time series of sea surface temperature, and land surface temperature. ESA awarded the GlobTemperature and Climate Change Initiative Land Surface Temperature projects to a team led by Leicester (PI, Dr. Ghent). The group has been supported by ESA to develop the LST algorithms for AATSR and SLSTR on Sentinel-3, and has produced the latest LST ATBDs for these instruments. In addition, the group is responsible for the latest developments in LST cloud masking for SLSTR, with their algorithm currently being implemented into the operational chain. Through Dr Ghent the team are involved in the S3MPC and provide the SLSTR LST algorithm as well as research on cloud clearing over land. The team is also part of the GBOV (Ground-Based Observations for Validation of Copernicus Land Products). The surface temperature group has become fundamentally involved in the early specification and developments towards a potential new Copernicus mission: Land Surface Temperature Mission (LSTM) with ESA. Dr. Ghent is also a member of the MAG from LSTM.

![AECSIC](images/CSIC.jpg "AECSIC")**The Spanish State Agency of the Higher Council for Scientific Research (AECSIC)** is the largest public institution dedicated to research in Spain and the third largest in Europe. Belonging to the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, its main objective is to develop and promote research that will help bring about scientific and technological progress, and it is prepared to collaborate with Spanish and foreign entities in order to achieve this aim. According to its Statute (article 4), its mission is to foster, coordinate, develop and promote scientific and technological research, of a multidisciplinary nature, in order to contribute to advancing knowledge and economic, social and cultural development, as well as to train staff and advise public and private entities on this matter.

AECSIC plays an important role in scientific and technological policy, since it encompasses an area that takes in everything from basic research to the transfer of knowledge to the productive sector. Its research is driven by its centres and institutes, which are spread across all the autonomous regions, and its more than 15,000 staff, of whom more than 3,000 are staff researchers and the same number again are doctors and scientists who are still training. AECSIC has 6% of all the staff dedicated to Research and Development in Spain, and they generate approximately 20% of all scientific production in the country. It also manages a range of important facilities; the most complete and extensive network of specialist libraries, and also has joint research units.

In order to undertake this mission, it is capacitated to carry out activities aimed at 1) The generation of knowledge through scientific and technical research 2) the transfer of research results, in particular to promote and create technology-based enterprises, 3) the provision of expert advice to public and private institutions, 4) the delivery of highly-qualified pre-doctoral and post-doctoral training, 5) the promotion of scientific culture in society, 6) The management of large facilities and unique scientific and technical infrastructures, 7) the presence and representation in international bodies, and 8) the development of targeted research.

For that reason AECSIC has participated in relevant international projects and networks related to this activities, such as the SENSECO ‘Optical synergies for spatiotemporal SENsing of Scalable ECOphysiological traits COST action, the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network on Remote Sensing for Ecosystem ModElling (TruStEE), or the DATI H2020 PRIMA project on Digital Agriculture Technologies for Irrigation efficiency.

![DHI](images/DHI.jpg "DHI")**DHI** is an independent, international consulting and research-based not-for-profit organization of more than 1100 employees, with offices in 30+ countries, project experience from more than 140 countries, and with more than 50 years of experience in water resources management and environmental sustainability. In the first part of 2021 DHI was reorganized to strengthen innovation and collaboration, to meet a new strategic focus on sustainability development and to deliver data driven advisory support in an international market. As such this activity is at the heart of our new strategy. Former DHI GRAS was incorporated into the new Earth Observation Center of Excellence (EO CoE) in which we are leveraging our strong background in remote sensing for environmental assessment and mapping and profound expertise in operational EO system and service including easy and convenient dissemination through our customized web portal development capabilities. The EO CoE section is used to adapt solutions to the specific needs of the user and the project context.

Of particular relevance for this proposal is the lead role of DHI GRAS in Sen-ET (http://esa-sen4et.org/) and ET4FAO (et4fao.dhigroup.com) projects. The objective of Sen-ET was to develop and validate methodology for combining Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 data to obtain high-resolution (20 m) evapotranspiration estimates. This was achieved through the use of machine-learning methods to bridge the spatial data gap between the thermal and optical Sentinel observations and to include the resulting data in a physical model of land-surface energy fluxes. In ET4FAO this method was further refined and operationalized to develop a water consumption monitoring service derived with EO observations coming purely from Copernicus satellites and delivered on multiple scales, including on local (field) scale. DHI GRAS was also leading Earth Observation for Sustainable Development activities which involved extensive consultations with International Finance Institutions and their client state partners in defining EO user needs and requirements in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and the subsequent demonstration on how agricultural EO applications based on time series of Sentinel data, can assist large International Financial Institutions (WB, IADB, ADB, IFAD, GEF etc.) and their agricultural and water resources project portfolio. Also, worth mentioning is our ongoing activity with FAO on demonstrating the utility of Sentinel-based evapotranspiration maps for consistent crop water use monitoring, from field to national scales, as preparation for future development of FAO’s WaPOR portal and involving a novel data fusion algorithm for sharpening land surface temperature measured by Sentinel-3 to Sentinel-2 scale, followed by a physically based modelling of land-surface energy fluxes.

To maintain a leading technology edge, we work with academic institutions within applied remote sensing in Denmark and elsewhere and to make sure state‑of‑the‑art knowledge is acquired. This is secured both via active presence in large scale research and development projects (H2020, Innovation Fund Denmark etc.) as well as through physical presence at the universities (guest lectures and co‑authoring of scientific papers) and through maintenance of personal relationships with university staff. Furthermore, DHI have ongoing and completed research and development projects with a broad range of clients including national agencies (e.g., ministries, coast guards, geodata agencies) to international organisations (e.g., ESA, IFIs, EU and UN) and NGOs (e.g., National Geographic, WWF) as well as private sector companies (e.g., wind companies). Finally, DnA has extensive experience in the development of Python based open source software and applications (e.g.,TigerNet, GlobWetland Africa and Sen‑ET). Common to these activities has been full release of tools and code in freely accessible online code repositories.
